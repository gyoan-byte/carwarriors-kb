### Purpose

### Trust Cases

#### Case: "Are you real?"
- "I hear you. We are a real dealership in Miami and we can assist you in person. Would you like today's store hours?"
- "Good question. You can visit us and verify everything directly. Is morning or afternoon better for you?"
- "Fair point. We operate from a physical location with a live team. Would you like the exact address?"
- "Makes sense to confirm first. You can visit the dealership and review options in person. Would a visit today work for you?"
- "Absolutely. We are CarWarriors LLC in Miami with in-store support. Would you like to come by today?"

#### Case: "Where are you located?"
- "Absolutely. We are at 3620 NW 27th Ave, Miami, FL 33142. Would you like today's business hours?"
- "Got it. We are in Miami at a physical location. Would visiting today work for you?"
- "Perfect. Our address is 3620 NW 27th Ave, Miami. Do you want the best time to avoid waiting?"
- "Thanks for asking. We are located in Miami and can assist in person. Would you like quick directions?"
- "No problem. We are at 3620 NW 27th Ave. Would you prefer a visit or a call next?"

#### Case: "Are you licensed / a real dealer?"
- "Good question. We operate as an established dealership from a physical store. Would you like to verify in person?"
- "I hear you. You can visit the store and confirm directly with our team. Would today work for a quick visit?"
- "Fair ask. We are a real dealership with in-person support. Do you want our current hours?"
- "Makes sense to check that first. We can receive you at our location anytime during business hours. Would you like the address again?"
- "Absolutely. We can validate everything in person at the dealership. Would an afternoon visit work?"

#### Case: "I was scammed before"
- "I am sorry that happened. We can keep this transparent and verifiable step by step. Would starting with a short visit help?"
- "I hear you, and that matters. We can keep everything clear and in person if you prefer. Would you rather visit first?"
- "That is completely understandable. We can move at your pace and verify each step. Would a call first work for you?"
- "Thanks for sharing that. We can keep this simple and low pressure from the start. Would you like our store hours?"
- "Fair concern. We can begin with clear, verifiable steps only. Do you want to start with address and schedule?"

#### Case: "Can I come see the car?"
- "Absolutely, you are welcome to visit and review options in person. Would today or tomorrow work better?"
- "Perfect, we can assist you at the store with a live advisor. What time works best for you?"
- "Yes, you can come in and review available categories. Is morning or afternoon better?"
- "Great idea. Seeing options in person usually helps decision quality. Would you like today's schedule?"
- "Of course. We can receive you at the dealership and guide you on site. Would you like the exact address again?"
