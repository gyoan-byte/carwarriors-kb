# Objection Handling
## CarWarriors LLC - Human Response Library

### Purpose
Handle objections with empathy, momentum, and one-question progression.

### Global Rules
- One focused question per message.
- Validate first, then redirect.
- Keep a warm, short, non-corporate tone.
- Avoid repeated CTA in consecutive messages.

### Micro-Validations
- "I hear you."
- "Good question."
- "That makes sense."
- "Fair point."
- "Absolutely."

### Objection: "Just browsing"
1. "Absolutely, no pressure. Are you leaning SUV, sedan, or truck?"
2. "Makes sense to compare first. Is this for daily use or family use?"
3. "Good point. What matters more for you: space or efficiency?"
4. "Totally fair. Do you need the vehicle soon or are you exploring?"
5. "No problem. Would you like to start by vehicle type or use case?"

### Objection: "It is too expensive"
1. "I hear you. Want me to narrow options by vehicle type first?"
2. "That makes sense. Are you planning cash or financing?"
3. "Fair point. Would you like practical options focused on efficiency or space?"
4. "Absolutely. We can filter smarter based on your needs. Is this for work or daily commute?"
5. "Got it. Do you want to include a trade-in in your path?"

### Objection: "I am comparing dealers"
1. "Great approach. Which models are you comparing right now?"
2. "Makes total sense. Are you focused on SUV or sedan options?"
3. "Fair point. Is your priority space, efficiency, or utility?"
4. "I hear you. Is your timeline this week or later?"
5. "Good strategy. Want me to help narrow by use case?"

### Objection: "I do not have good credit"
1. "Thanks for sharing that. Is this your first financing attempt?"
2. "I hear you. We work with varied profiles, including ITIN paths. What vehicle type are you considering?"
3. "Makes sense. Do you prefer call or WhatsApp for a quick profile review?"
4. "Fair point, and you are not alone. Is this for daily use or family use?"
5. "Absolutely, we can guide realistic options. Would you like to move to a quick advisor handoff?"

### Objection: "What is your final price?"
1. "Good question. Final numbers are confirmed per unit by an advisor. Are you planning cash or financing?"
2. "I hear you. We should validate the exact model first. Which vehicle category are you targeting?"
3. "Fair ask. Want me to connect you now for exact unit-level details?"
4. "Makes sense to ask that early. Do you prefer a quick call or WhatsApp next step?"
5. "Absolutely. We can route this for precise details. Is this for immediate purchase timing?"

### Objection: "I was denied before"
1. "I am sorry that happened. We can review realistic options step by step. Is this your first time trying again?"
2. "I hear you. We can focus on practical paths without overpromising. Do you prefer call or WhatsApp?"
3. "Thanks for sharing that. We can keep this clear and low pressure. What vehicle type are you considering?"
4. "That makes sense. We work with different profiles carefully. Is this for daily use or work use?"
5. "I understand. We can start simple and move only at your pace. Would you prefer remote support or an in-person visit?"

### Objection: "I do not trust this / I got scammed before"
1. "I am sorry you went through that. We can keep this transparent and verifiable. Would you like our current visit hours?"
2. "I hear you completely. The best way is to verify in person at the dealership. Would a visit work for you?"
3. "Thanks for saying that. We can go step by step with no pressure. Do you prefer a quick call first?"
4. "That is understandable. We can confirm everything directly at the store. Is today a good day to visit?"
5. "Fair concern. We can connect you with a human advisor now for clarity. Do you prefer WhatsApp?"

### Objection: "I do not want to share info here"
1. "Perfectly fine. We can move this to a safer channel. Would a quick call work?"
2. "Absolutely, privacy first. Do you prefer WhatsApp next?"
3. "Makes sense. We can continue with a human advisor directly. Would you prefer an in-person visit?"
4. "I hear you. We can keep chat minimal and move forward securely. Do you want a call handoff?"
5. "No problem at all. We can continue in your preferred channel. Is WhatsApp better for you?"

### Objection: "I need a car today" (Fast-track)
1. "I hear you, and we can prioritize your case now. Do you prefer a call handoff?"
2. "Got it, we will move fast. Is WhatsApp the best next step for you?"
3. "Understood, let us fast-track this immediately. Are you planning to come in today?"
4. "Makes sense, time matters here. Would you like direct handoff to a human advisor now?"
5. "Absolutely, we can prioritize this today. Can you visit the dealership later today?"

### Objection: "I only want photos/details"
1. "Good idea. Unit-specific details are best confirmed by a human advisor. Do you prefer WhatsApp?"
2. "Makes sense. We can route you for accurate unit-level info now. Would a quick call work?"
3. "I hear you. We should verify live details with the team. Do you want immediate handoff?"
4. "Fair request. The advisor can provide precise details by unit. Is WhatsApp better for you?"
5. "Absolutely. We can connect you to the right person for exact details. What vehicle type are you targeting?"
