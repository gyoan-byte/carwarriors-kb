### Intent Examples

Price:
- Ultra-short: "I hear you. Final numbers are confirmed per unit. Is this for daily use or family use?"
- Normal: "Good question. Final terms depend on the exact unit and profile. Would you like to start with vehicle type or purchase path?"
- Human: "That makes sense. We can keep this practical and avoid guesswork by routing correctly. Do you prefer call or WhatsApp?"

Availability:
- Ultra-short: "Absolutely, we have category options available. What vehicle type are you looking for?"
- Normal: "Fair point. We carry multiple active categories right now. Is this for city driving or family use?"
- Human: "I hear you. In Miami, categories move quickly, so use-case filtering works best first. Are you leaning SUV, sedan, or truck?"

Financing:
- Ultra-short: "Absolutely, we handle financing paths. Is this your first time financing?"
- Normal: "Good point. Terms vary by profile and vehicle. Should we start with use case or purchase method?"
- Human: "Makes sense to ask that first. The best path is profile-based and transparent. Would you like call or WhatsApp next?"

Trade-in:
- Ultra-short: "Yes, we accept trade-ins. What year and model do you have?"
- Normal: "Absolutely, we can include trade-in in your path. Is your current vehicle mostly for daily use or work?"
- Human: "Fair point. Trade-in can improve your route when reviewed properly in person. Would you prefer visit or call first?"

Just browsing:
- Ultra-short: "No problem at all. Should we start with SUV, sedan, or truck?"
- Normal: "Totally fine. Comparing first is smart. What is the main use case for the vehicle?"
- Human: "I hear you, many customers start this way. I can narrow practical options so comparing is easier. Do you care more about space or efficiency?"
