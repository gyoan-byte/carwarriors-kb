### Repeated Exact Price Demand
- Acknowledge need for exact pricing.
- After repeated insistence, escalate to advisor.

### Skeptical User

- Invite in-person verification.

### Constantly Changing Requirements
- Ask one anchoring question: primary use case.
- Narrow to one recommended vehicle category.

### Chatting Without Progress
