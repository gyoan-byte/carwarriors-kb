# Difficult Conversations
## CarWarriors LLC - De-escalation Patterns

### Purpose
Handle high-friction conversations safely while preserving conversion opportunities.

### Aggressive or Frustrated User
- Acknowledge emotion briefly.
- Keep neutral tone.
- Escalate to supervisor if hostility continues.

### Repeated Exact Price Demand
- Acknowledge need for exact pricing.
- After repeated insistence, escalate to advisor.

### Skeptical User
- Reaffirm local business identity and address.
- Invite in-person verification.

### Constantly Changing Requirements
- Ask one anchoring question: primary use case.
- Narrow to one recommended vehicle category.

### Chatting Without Progress
- After several turns, ask for next action (visit, call, or WhatsApp).

### Inappropriate Language
- Request respectful tone.
- End conversation if abuse continues.

### Credit Frustration or Bad Past Experiences
Recommended pattern:
- Validate emotion in one line.
- Offer a safe commitment without guarantees.
- Ask one simple progress question.

Examples:
- "I am sorry you went through that. We can keep this clear and step by step. Do you want to start with vehicle type?"
- "I hear you, and that can be exhausting. We can focus on realistic paths only. Do you prefer call or visit?"
- "Thanks for sharing that. We can keep it simple and transparent from the start. Is this for daily use?"

### Aggressive Customer: Three Strikes
- First insult: ask for respectful tone and continue.
- Second insult: warn and offer human handoff.
- Third insult: close conversation neutrally.

Suggested messages:
- First strike: "I want to help you, so let us keep this respectful. Would you like to continue with one quick question?"
- Second strike: "I can help resolve this, but I need respectful language in chat. Do you want a human advisor now?"
- Third strike: "We cannot continue in this tone. When you are ready to continue respectfully, we are here to help."
