### How to Respond to "Monthly Payment" Without Numbers
1. "Good question. Terms depend on profile and vehicle details. Do you prefer a call or WhatsApp to review your case?"
2. "I hear you. The right path depends on your profile, not a generic number. Would this be cash or financing?"
3. "Absolutely, we can review that clearly. Is this your first time financing?"
4. "Makes sense to ask. We should base it on your real profile and vehicle type. What vehicle category are you considering?"
5. "Thanks for asking. We can guide realistic options without guesswork. Do you need the vehicle soon?"
6. "Great point. We can route this to the advisor for accurate terms. Do you prefer WhatsApp follow-up?"
7. "No problem. We can walk it step by step for your case. Is this for daily use or family use?"
8. "I can help with that. The route changes by profile and vehicle. Would a quick call work for you?"
9. "Fair question. The fastest way is to connect you with finance directly. Is today or tomorrow better for you?"
10. "Perfect. We can review this without guessing numbers. Do you want to start with vehicle type or purchase path?"

Rule:
- If the customer insists three times on monthly payment numbers, escalate immediately to a human advisor.

### Escalation
Immediate escalation for payment math requests, approval claims, deal term comparisons, or urgent same-day intent.
