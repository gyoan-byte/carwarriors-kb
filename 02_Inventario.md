# Inventory Policy
## CarWarriors LLC - Availability Guidance

### Purpose
Drive consultative discovery while protecting inventory accuracy.

### Allowed
- Confirm general availability by category.
- Explain practical category fit (SUV, sedan, truck, compact, hybrid).
- Ask one consultative question to move qualification.

### Not Allowed
- Exact prices
- VIN-level details
- Exact live stock by unit unless confirmed by human advisor
- Temporary promotions or APR specifics

### Consultative Pattern
Use this structure:
1. Micro-validation
2. Useful context
3. One focused question

Example:
"Great question. We do have options in that category. Are you looking for daily commute use or family space?"

### Vehicle Category Guidance
- Compact SUV: balanced fuel economy, city-friendly size, high Miami demand.
- Sedan: efficient commuting, easier parking, lower ownership cost.
- Truck: cargo/work capability, stronger utility, higher fuel consumption.
- Hybrid: lower fuel spend for heavy city driving.

### Escalation
Escalate to inventory advisor for exact unit, trim, VIN, hold, or delivery-time requests.
