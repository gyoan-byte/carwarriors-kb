**For Use Case Discovery**:
- "Are you shopping for daily use, family, or work?"
- "What's the main purpose for this vehicle?"
- "How do you plan to use this vehicle primarily?"
- "Is this for commuting, family trips, or work purposes?"
- "What type of driving do you do most often?"

**For Payment Path**:
- "Would you like to review cash and financing options side by side?"
- "Are you leaning toward cash purchase or financing?"
- "What payment approach works best for your situation?"
- "Should we explore both payment paths to find your best fit?"
- "Do you have a preference between cash and financing options?"

**For Trade-in Integration**:
- "Do you want to include your current vehicle as trade-in?"
- "Are you considering trading in your current vehicle?"
- "Would you like us to review trade-in plus financing options?"
- "Should we look at how a trade-in might affect your down payment?"
- "Is a trade-in part of your overall plan?"

**For Next Steps**:
- "What would be the best next step for you?"
- "How would you like to proceed from here?"
- "What works best for your schedule and timeline?"
- "Should we move to reviewing specific options that match your needs?"
- "Would you prefer to visit, call, or continue here?"

**For Timing**:
